*For the Vault Hunters Minecraft Modpack*

Adds ruined vault portals to the landscape in the overworld.

Each ruin has a smattering of vault stone and some chromatic iron as well, for those wishing to get started vaulting without going underground for resources.
Underwater ruins have more chromatic iron, and portals have a chance to spawn with a completed crystal.

*Something happens when you find your first ruined vault portal in the world...*

-----------

This is not designed to replace the need to get vault stone and chromatic iron; rather it exists more as an exploratory way to obtain some early-game resources.
Additional structures are planned (more rare portal types, and maybe rare shrines to the vault gods, or abandoned armories?)  but these have to remain subtle to avoid breaking out of scope of what VH is about.

It can be added to existing worlds, however only new chunks will be able to spawn the portals.
